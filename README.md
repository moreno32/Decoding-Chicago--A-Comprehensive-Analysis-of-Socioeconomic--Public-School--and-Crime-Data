# Decoding Chicago: A Comprehensive Analysis of Socioeconomic, Public School, and Crime Data

## 🔄 Overview:
In this project, we aim to shed light on the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors, public school performance, and crime trends in the city of Chicago. Using data from the city's data portal, we will analyze three datasets: Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago, Chicago Public Schools, and Chicago Crime Data. With the help of SQL and Pandas, we will store the datasets in database tables and tackle various SQL problems to uncover correlations and insights into the city's fabric.
